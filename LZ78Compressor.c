/**
 * The bytes of the file to be compressed are read using fread.
 * fread improves the performances of the read syscall adding a buffering
 * layer: the cost of the read syscall is amortized reading more than the
 * requested bytes and buffering them, so that the next calls can avoid the
 * costly read syscall and return the buffer content.
 * Anyway, fread also has a cost (at least, the cost of construction of the
 * activation record).
 * The compressor choises are taken for each byte read. But, if a different
 * call to fread is done for each read byte, the total cost of calling fread
 * can be high. To reduce that cost, we adopted the same strategy used by
 * fread: another buffering layer is introduced. The bytes are accessed on
 * the buffer, and when all the buffered bytes have been used, a fread call
 * is done to fill up the buffer. So, the fread cost is amortized of a
 * factor which is proportional to the buffer size.
 * The LOCAL_BYTE_BUFFER_LENGTH constant is the length for this local buffer.
